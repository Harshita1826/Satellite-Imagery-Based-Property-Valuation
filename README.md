# Satellite Imagery Based Property Valuation
This project builds a multimodal regression system that predicts property prices by combining:

Tabular housing data (sqft, bedrooms, grade, etc.)

Satellite imagery (neighborhood + surroundings)

Deep learning + machine learning fusion

The goal is to understand how environment + house features together influence price.
